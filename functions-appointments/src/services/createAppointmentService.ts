/**
 * createAppointmentService.ts
 *
 * Single‚Äêpurpose service that writes an appointment document into Firestore.
 * 
 * It:
 *   1) Extracts the appointmentId (used as the Firestore doc ID).
 *   2) Strips out appointmentId from the payload so we never write an undefined field.
 *   3) Writes the rest of appointmentData under appointments/{appointmentId}.
